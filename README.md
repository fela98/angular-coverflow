# angular-coverflow

This is an angular module, that provides a directive. This directive mimicks the iTunes coverflow you can add images to it and they will display in 3D. Currently will everything be circular. Which means that you can never reach the end of the coverflow. It will just repeat itself.

Stay tuned, more is coming!
